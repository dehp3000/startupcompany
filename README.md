## Garry Hurst Repository for Modding information

This will be a repo of modding information and examples I will create to help others who wish to mod this game.

 ***mod.json*** <-- This is just who you are and what your mod does.
 
 ***start.js*** <-- This is the meat your main js file.
 
 ***object_schema*** <-- This will be a schematic basically where you can learn and understand different in game objects and how they are built.
